Okay, so this is story test one. I'm going to introduce the characters in the story and mention a few of their traits. Hopefully this will be used to get to fill in the character profile. So there's myself, I'm John. I am 43 years old. I am married to Leo, L-E-O. I have a 10-year-old daughter named Sophie. She was born from a previous marriage and spends half the time with us. I have a son who just recently turned two years old in February of 2023, he turned two. And Adelina, who has just turned one at the end of June in 2023. And we took a, for the story, we took a vacation, drove to Florida in the fall, in October of 2022, along with my mother-in-law, Nancy. Nancy is Leo's mom and typically lives in Spain, in Madrid, but came to visit us for several months after Adelina was born. So we drove down our first road trip with a baby, Adelina, who was just about four months old at the time. Drove down to Santa Rosa Beach, Florida in our first road trip, which was very exciting. We spent our time playing in the pool, playing cards, walking around eating ice cream, and of course, playing at the beach. Playing at the beach meant running around in the waves, playing in the sand, Adelina trying sand for the first time, Luca learning about sand castles with a lot of guidance from his big sister, Sophie. And then culminated with an amazing evening on the beach at the sunset with all of us smiling, taking pictures, having fun, enjoying our last evening on the beach before the drive back home. It was an amazing first family road trip with a full five-person family plus mother-in-law, and we will look forward to doing it many times in the future.
